# WeatherForecast

This app can be used as a minimal API template to start a new project.
It has some basic frameworks and foundations that let you easily expand, but also getting a head start on your development

## Concepts used

In this app, I am using just simple principles of software design, to serve as an example of a minimal Microservice.
It offers caching for the external API (to avoid multiple calls, saving costs)
